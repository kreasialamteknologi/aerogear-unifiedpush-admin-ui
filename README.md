## Contributing and Releases

This project follows conventional comments and semantic versioning. Every commit to master is automatically versioned and tagged. GitHub released tags automatically get built as containers and uploaded as an image to our [Quay repository](https://quay.io/repository/aerogear/unifiedpush-admin-ui).

### Container information

The container requires the Unified Push server be routable. You need to set the `UPS_HOST` environment variable to run the container. When running, the container exposes the admin ui on port 80.

### Building the Container

We provide an automatically released container in our [Quay repository](https://quay.io/repository/aerogear/unifiedpush-admin-ui). To build the container locally, use `./container/Dockerfile` with the context of the project root.

For example,

`podman build -t ups-ui -f ./container/Dockerfile .`
